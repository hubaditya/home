      content="I am an applied Data Scientist currently pursuing master's from the University of Cincinnati, Carl H. Lindner College of Business majoring in Business Analytics. I like working in ambitious environments upholding the true spirits of data insights meeting business decisions. Through my previous employments, I have a proven track record of strong client consultancy, applied analytics and product strategy with experience in creating data models, using predictive data modeling for visualization and analyzing with algorithms. My goal has always been to create a positive impact via technology and machine learning to sustain a better future for everyone. I would love to be a part of a company that not only assists me in giving vision to my goals but also excites me of the challenges that await in realizing them.""

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
